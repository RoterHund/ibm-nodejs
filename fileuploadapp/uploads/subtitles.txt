[MUSIC] Welcome to load balancing and
high availability. After watching this video, you'll be able
to state benefits of load balancing. Explain the importance of load
balancing and high availability. Describe different load
balancing techniques. Explain how to implement load
balancing in node applications. Explain high availability strategies for
node applications. Explain techniques and strategies for
application resilience and fault recovery. Load balancing involves the distribution
of incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure
optimal resource utilization, increased reliability,
and improved performance. It helps prevent any single server from
becoming overwhelmed with requests, reducing downtime and
improving the overall user experience. High availability refers to
the ability of a system to operate even when some
of its components fail. It involves designing the system in such a
way that it can automatically recover from failures, ensuring uninterrupted
service availability. Node handles concurrent
connections efficiently, however, as concurrent connections increase in
a single node, it may become a bottleneck. Load balancing allows you to distribute
incoming requests across multiple nodes, enabling horizontal scaling and
improved performance. High availability ensures that
even if one or more nodes fail, the application remains
accessible to users. You implement high availability
strategies to minimize downtime and provide a seamless user experience. Load balancing algorithms determine how
incoming requests are distributed across server instances. Different algorithms are suitable for
different scenarios. Round-robin load balancing distributes
requests equally across server instances in a cyclic manner. This technique ensures a fair
distribution of request, but does not take server load into account. The least connection load balancing
technique ensures that heavily loaded servers receive fewer requests,
allowing them to recover faster. IP hash load balancing assigns requests
based on the client's IP address. Requests from the same IP address are
consistently routed to the same server. This technique maintains
session persistence. Session persistence ensures that
the user sessions are maintained on the same server instance
throughout their duration. Sticky sessions assign each
user's request to the same server based on a server identifier stored
in cookies or URL parameters. To set up a basic load
balancer using node, you can use libraries like HTTP proxy or
node HTTP proxy. These libraries allow us to create
a reverse proxy that distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers. Here is an example code for setting
up a basic load balancer using node. Here, the line const addresses
declare an array called addresses that holds the dummy server addresses that
the proxy will distribute requests. Reverse proxies like Nginx and HaProxy offload the task of load
balancing from node servers. They act as intermediaries between
clients and backend servers, distributing incoming requests
based on predefined rules. Here's an example of Nginx
configuration for load balancing. To configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for
load balancing, you define upstream servers and configure
the load balancing algorithm using directories like upstream and proxy pass. Similarly, HaProxy provides
configuration options for load balancing using backend servers. Load balancing strategies vary based
on the type of node application being deployed. For HTTP-based applications,
simple round-robin or least connection load
balancing may suffice. However, for WebSocket applications
that require sticky sessions or session persistence, IP hash or sticky
session techniques are more appropriate. It is important to analyze the
requirements of your specific application and choose the most suitable load
balancing strategy accordingly. High availability involves designing
systems that can withstand component failure and
continue to provide uninterrupted service. It requires redundancy at various levels, fault tolerance mechanisms, and
efficient recovery strategies. Designing for high availability in node
applications involves architectural considerations such as redundancy, deploying multiple nodes to ensure
availability even when some nodes fail. Fault tolerance,
implementing mechanisms to detect and recover from failures automatically. Data replication, replicating
data across multiple instances or databases to ensure availability. Elasticity, designing applications that
can scale dynamically based on demand. To implement fault tolerance and
redundancy in node applications, consider the following techniques. Cluster module, the built in cluster
module in node allows you to create a cluster of worker processes
that can share the same port and handle incoming requests efficiently. Process monitoring, monitoring tools
like PM tool can automatically restart failed instances or scale up and
down based on resource usage thresholds. Load balancers, using load balancers
ensures that even if some instances fail, the application remains accessible
through other healthy instances. Distributed caching manages session
data across multiple instances in a high availability setup. You ensure session persistence even
if the individual nodes fail to store session data in a distributed
cache like Redis or Memcached. We can ensure session persistence
even if individual nodes fail. Implementing health checks and
failure detection mechanisms, health checks involve periodically
checking the status of various application stack components to
ensure they function correctly. Failure detection mechanisms detect
failures or anomalies in real time by monitoring system metrics or
using heartbeat-based techniques. Graceful shutdown and restart strategies, graceful shutdown allows
existing connections or transactions to be completed before
shutting down the application gracefully. Graceful restart strategies involve
restarting an application without causing downtime or service interruptions. Handling session persistence during
node failures, during node failures, you should ensure session persistence
is to maintain a good user experience. Techniques such as distributed caching,
as discussed earlier, or sharing session state
across multiple instances, help achieve session persistence
during node failures. Disaster recovery planning and strategies,
disaster recovery planning involves preparing for unexpected events that may
cause service interruptions or data loss. Strategies include regular
backups of critical data, redundant infrastructure deployments
across geographically distinct regions or data centers, and
well-defined recovery procedures. In this video, you learned about load
balancing and high availability. Incoming requests are distributed
across server instances using a load-balancing algorithm. Load balancing algorithms such as
round-robin, least connection, IP hash, and session persistence and sticky
sessions help to distribute incoming requests across multiple node instances. Define the upstream servers and configure the load balancing algorithm
to configure reverse proxies like Nginx. High availability allows the design of
systems that can withstand component failures and
continue to provide uninterrupted service. Use high availability strategies
such as redundancy, fault tolerance, data replication, and elasticity
to provide uninterrupted service. Apply techniques like cluster modules,
process monitoring, and load balancers to implement fault tolerance and
redundancy in node applications.
